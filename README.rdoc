== DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby extension for the ftd2xx usb driver (see http://ftdichip.com)

== REQUIREMENTS

Intel Mac OSX (tested on Snow Leopard)
FTDI D2XX device drivers, can be downloaded here:
	http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX/MacOSX/UniBin/D2XX0.1.7.dmg


note: The d2xx driver can not coexist with the VCP driver, if you have both
      remove the VCP driver (see http://ftdichip.com for instuctions). Remember
      to do kextunload if you don't restart your system.

== USAGE:

Initialize:
If you have device that has been configured by a specific vendor, start by setting the VIDPID

	Ftd2xx.ft_set_vidpid(0x1781,0x0c30)					

verify that your device is connected and present (returns the number of ftdi enabled devices)

	device_index = Ftd2xx.create_device_info_list - 1
	
open the device if not allready open

	handle = Ftd2xx.open(device_index)
	
optional if your vendor requires it, set baudrate etc.

	Ftd2xx.ft_set_baud_rate(handle,4800)
	Ftd2xx.ft_set_timeouts(handle,5000,0)

Once you have initialized your device and have a handle you can start, reading and wirting
to the device

The general reading loop looks like this:

    bytes_read = 1
    c = " "
    while (bytes_read != 0) and (c != "\n")
      c = " "
      bytes_read = Ftd2xx.read(@handle,c)
    end

The general writing loop looks like this:

    "Hello World!".scan(/.{1,8}/).each do |str|
      Ftd2xx.write(handle,str)
    end
    
When your done, remember to close:

	Ftd2xx.close
